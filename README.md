# Christoffel’s Kitchen

## App Design
Christoffel, the client, is a renowned chef known for his culinary expertise, so the app has to have a user-friendly design with a style that captures the user and embodies his personality.

### Home page
The homepage will serve as an introduction to the chef and his business. It will have a brief overview of him and the cuisine he specialises in.
A hero image will cover the top section of the page, creating a strong visual impression. Below the image, there will be text highlighting the chef’s background, experiences and culinary style.
Navigation will be handled using buttons imported from React Native. These will be placed at the bottom of the page for convenience. The buttons include:
* A home button - linked to the home page
* Menu button – linked to the menu page
* Payment button – linked to the payment page
* A management button – linked to the management page. Only visible when the chef signs in

### Menu page
The menu page stands as a centrepiece of the app, an elegant showcase of the chef’s finest culinary creations. Each dish will be presented on an individual card layout, designed for clarity and visual appeal.
On the left side of the card:
* An image of the dish
On the right side of the card:
* A name for the dish
* A description of the dish
* The price of the dish
* A button to add the dish to the cart
The menu will also feature three buttons so the user can choose which course they desire, and the cuisines will be filtered accordingly.
Just like the home page, the bottom will consist of the three navigation buttons.

### Payment page
The payment page will use the same card layout as the menu, only displaying the dishes added to the cart.  A confirm purchase button will be placed below the food list. When the user presses the button, an alert will pop up as a second-step verification of the purchase. The user will press confirm and enjoy a culinary masterpiece in the comfort of their own home.
The bottom of the page will contain the three navigation buttons

### The Management page
This page is exclusive to the chef. This is where he will be given the opportunity to change any information he pleases.
The page will feature a dropdown menu which has all the items displayed in the menu. He will be able to pick an item and change the name, description, image and price of the item. The page is only available when he signs in to his account.
The bottom of the page will contain the aforementioned three navigation buttons.
